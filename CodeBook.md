# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

An analysis of data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The "Human Activity Recognition Using
 Smartphones Data Set" contains 10299 observations of 561 variables.

>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 1948 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded Accelerometerelerometer and Gyroscopescope, we captured 3axial linear Accelerometereleration and 3axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been videorecorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

>The sensor signals (Accelerometerelerometer and Gyroscopescope) were preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixedwidth sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor Accelerometereleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth lowpass filter into body Accelerometereleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

> Triaxial Accelerometereleration from the Accelerometerelerometer (total Accelerometereleration) and the estimated body Accelerometereleration.
> Triaxial Angular velocity from the Gyroscopescope. 
> A 561feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
> Its activity label. 
> An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

For our purposes the data was trimmed to only include variables of TestSubject, Activity, and 
measurement data that calculated either a Mean or a StdDev deviation.

Test Subject:  an ID number to identify a specific test subject without revealing the person's name.

Activity: a character string to describe what the test subject was doing during the observation.
* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
