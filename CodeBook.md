# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Human Activity Project CodeBook

## Introduction
The data used for this project was from the
**UCI Machine Learning Repository**. I have included the data set
description from the **UCI** website at the end this **CodeBook**.

## Variables 
For our purposes the data was trimmed to only include variables of
TestSubject, Activity, and measurement data that calculated either
a Mean or a StdDev deviation.

**Test Subject**:  an ID number to identify a specific test subject
without revealing the person's name.

**Activity**: a character string to describe what the test subject
was doing during the observation: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING

The following variables are based on the information from the original
data set and the units are described therein:

## The Original Data Description from README.txt included in the Dataset.
An analysis of data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The 
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" contains
10299 observations of 561 variables.

>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within 
>an age bracket of 1948 years. Each person performed six activities 
>(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
>WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone  
>(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.  
>Using its embedded Accelerometerelerometer and Gyroscope, we captured
>3axial linear Accelerometereleration and 3axial angular velocity at 
>a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been videorecorded to
>label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly 
>partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected
>for generating the training data and 30% the test data.  
>The sensor signals (Accelerometerelerometer and Gyroscopescope)
>were preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in 
>fixedwidth sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap
>(128 readings/window). The sensor Accelerometereleration signal,
>which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using
>a Butterworth lowpass filter into body Accelerometereleration and
>gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency
>components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.
>From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating 
>variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt'
>for more details.  
>For each record it is provided:  
>Triaxial Accelerometereleration from the Accelerometerelerometer 
>(total Accelerometereleration) and the estimated body 
>Accelerometereleration.  
>Triaxial Angular velocity from the Gyroscopescope.  
>A 561 feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.  
>Its activity label.  
>An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
